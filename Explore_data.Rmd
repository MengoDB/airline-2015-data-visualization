This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd('/Users/elsieyao/Desktop/goodgoodstudy/Nano/Data Visualization//project')
data <- read.csv('test.csv')
str(data)
library(ggplot2)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = year_month, y = on_time_ct, group = carrier), data = data) + geom_point(aes(colour = carrier)) + geom_line(aes(colour = carrier))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
